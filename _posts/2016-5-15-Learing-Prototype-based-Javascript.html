title: Learning Javascript

<p>
Grammar just has no special. To understand JavaScript, the most important thing is to understand what is prototype-based. 
</p>

<h3><b>Comparing to Java(C++, C#)</b></h3>
<p>
This is an easy to have general concept.JavaScript is an Object-oriented (prototype-based) language. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically. (dynamic inheritance)</p>
<p>
Java is a Classed-based language. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have proterties or methods added dynamically.</p>
<br />
<p>
JavaScript define and create objects with constructor functions.</p>
<p>
Java define a class with a class definition; instantiate a class with constructor methods.</p>
<br />
<p>
JavaScript construct an object hierarchy by assigning an object as the prototype associated with a constructor function. And inherit properties by following the prototype chain.</p>
<p>
Java construct an object hierarchy by using class definitions to define subclasses of existing classes. And inherit properties by following the class chain.</p>
<br />
<p>
Here is a picture to help understand prototype chain.

<p>
Here is a screen shot to help understand the relationship between prototype and the constructor.

<p>
So only a "function typed" object has property "prototype", which is the template help to construct a new object, and the prototype has property "constructor", which refers back to the function. And all objects have property "constructor", and all objects have property "__proto__", like below picture.

<h3><b>Adding properties.</b></h3>
<p>
Properties can be added to any object at run time. Properties can be added to the object itself or to all objects that inherit properties from the prototype, like below.</p>
